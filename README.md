# Make some noise. unleashing the power of convolutional neural networks for profiled side-channel analysis

This repository archives the code-base used for the project, [published](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/8292) in the title of this README.


## Getting Started

Anyone who're interested in this code-base, simply clone it. It contains a few Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model definitions using `pytorch` package, along with the utilities to conduct the training / validation.


## Data

The data is available at [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Preprocessed_dataset_for_the_paper_Make_some_noise_unleashing_the_power_of_convolutional_neural_networks_for_profiled_side-channel_analysis_/21950588) repository. For the detailed info for the dataset, we kindly ask you to check the landing page there.


## Contributing

Since the project is currently not maintained at the moment, the update is going to be minimal. But if there are any bugs / issues found, please feel free to report on the issue.
