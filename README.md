# Make some noise. unleashing the power of convolutional neural networks for profiled side-channel analysis

This repository archives the code-base used for the project, published in the title of this README.


## Getting Started

Anyone who're interested in this code-base, simply clone it to refer. It contains a few Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model definitions using `pytorch` package, along with the utilities to conduct the training / validation.


## Contributing

Since the project is currently not maintained at the moment, the update is going to be minimal. But if there are any bugs / issues found, please feel free to report on the issue.
